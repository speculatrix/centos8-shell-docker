# centos8-shell-docker

sometimes you need a CentOS8 environment but a VM would be overkill

run the BUILDME.sh script and give it your username

run the C8SHELL.sh script and it will drop you into a CentOS8 environment

edit the Dockerfile.tpl if you want to add more packages then run the BUILDME.sh again.

useful_aliases.sh contains some useful shortcuts; since aliases are case
sensitive, these shouldn't clash with anything else

use ". ./useful_aliases.sh" to pick these up
